### Hello World!

What is this? Well, it's my submission to Apple's Student Swift Challenge 2023, but for PC!

I'm still trying to figure out some things but this is kinda it! Hope ya like it and if you have some comments or suggestions, feel free to contact me!

### What's left?
Plenty of things! This program is infinitely scalable!

- [ ] Add file support
- [ ] Make it prettier
- [ ] Edited tasks change the date
- [ ] Add a GUI (Is that even possible?)
  - sit tight and watch :)
