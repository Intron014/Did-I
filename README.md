### Hello World!

What is this? Well, it's my submission to Apple's Student Swift Challenge 2023, but for PC!

I'm still trying to figure out some things but this is kinda it! Hope ya like it and if you have some comments or suggestions, feel free to contact me!

(Also, the original Xcode code can be found in the repo)
----
### What's left on the C version?
Plenty of things! This program is infinitely scalable!
- [ ] Add file support
- [ ] Make it prettier
- [ ] Edited tasks change the date
- [ ] Add a GUI
----
### What's left on the Swift version?
- [ ] Add a gesture for long pressing
- [ ] Maybe edit up the UI, but I think it's fine
